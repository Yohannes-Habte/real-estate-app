## What is the difference between dev team and production team?
- The development environment is your local computer, while the production environment is the live product customers or visitors might interact with. Since it can be hard to remember new technical vocabulary, I've used the following mnemonic: development â€“> developer coding on their computer.

## What is the difference between production server and development server?
- Typically, a server in a development environment allows unrestricted access to and control by a user or group of users. A production server, on the other hand, is configured to restrict access to authorized users and to limit control to system administrators.
